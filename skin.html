The film stars Trevante Rhodes, André Holland, Janelle Monáe, Ashton Sanders, Jharrel Jerome, Naomie Harris, and Mahershala Ali. It challenges our beliefs and biases, asking questions on the intersectionality of an individual’s identity and how it affects the community these individuals came from.">

Growing up there, amongst the vastness of all that nature, he says, shaped the ways in which he relates to life, to other people and the way in which he makes pictures too.Using a mix of both analogue and digital photography, his work is richly layered in a palette of deep scarlets and oranges, blacks and blues, often taking the form of bold studio shots, darkroom experiments and collages sketched upon or layered with text.">
